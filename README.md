# ApplePie

### Batter:

- 2 eggs
- 9 Tbsp sugar 
- 9 Tbpp milk
- 9 Tbpp vegetable oil
- 12 Tbsp flour
- 1 Tbsp baking powder

### Filling:

- 1 KG apple (~ 6 apples)
- Sugar - by taste
- Walnuts - by taste
- Cinammon - by taste 

### Batter:

Whisk the eggs with the sugar really well. Add flour mixed in with baking powder, then milk. Slowly incorporate the oil.
The batter should be runny when picked up with a spoon.

### Filling:

Peel, and grate the apples, simmer together with the sugar/walnuts/cinammon for a few minutes until warm, then drain the water from it (using a kitchen towel perhaps)

### Baking:

Line the baking tray with butter and flours. Pour half of the batter and bake for 10-12 minutes in a pre-heated oven (~ 180 with fan)
Take out and add the apple filling, and then the rest of the batter. Pop back in for ~ 40 minutes. Use a toothpick to test if it's done.
